# Employee Tracker
This application can be used to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in a business structure so it can be used to organize and plan a business. This application uses an SQL database stored on a localhost to save files(a seeds.sql filwe has been added for trial data). Node is then used to prompt the user (through inquirer) for various inputs.
